/**
 * Readtastic is a fast, minimalistic, lightweight, promise-based tool for interacting with input streams line by line.
 * 
 * It simplifies the process of reading user input, making it easy to create interactive command-line applications.
 * 
 * Learn more about it from [here](https://github.com/blazeinferno64/readtastic.js).
 * 
 * @example
 * // Require it in your project using CommonJS syntax:
 * const readtastic = require("readtastic");
 * 
 * // Or import it into your project if you're using ES modules:
 * import readtastic from "readtastic";
